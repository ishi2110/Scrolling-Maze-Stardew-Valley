I'm developing a scrolling maze that users can navigate using arrow keys. In this interactive environment, characters can not only explore the maze but also interact with various objects, allowing them to pick up items and place them back. Utilizing a DE1-SoC with VGA and timers, this project combines elements of smooth character movement, engaging gameplay, and user-friendly controls to create an immersive and enjoyable experience.
